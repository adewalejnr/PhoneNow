# PhoneNow Customer Retention Analysis

## ✅ BREIF INTRODUCTION
Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned and losing them is a big loss. The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination. 
Currently, the department get in touch after customers have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk.

## ✅ GOAL
The Retention department would like to know more about their customers: by Creating a dashboard and visualising clearly the KPIs to explain findings and suggestions as to what step to take to better retain customers and avoid churn
